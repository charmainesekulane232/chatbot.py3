## 📋 Project Overview
FashionistaBot is a professional-grade terminal application designed to provide personalized fashion consultancy. By bridging the gap between user preferences and global style trends, the system offers data-driven wardrobe recommendations. 

The engine is built with a modular architecture, simulating a live connection to the **Pinterest V5 API** to fetch real-time aesthetic trends, making it a viable prototype for e-commerce integration.

* **Professional UX/UI:** A clean, minimalist command-line interface (CLI) optimized for a distraction-free user experience.
* **Daily Style Heuristics:** A "Fashion Tip of the Day" engine that utilizes randomization algorithms to provide actionable styling advice.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Features deep-level exception handling to manage network failures and dependency issues without system crashes.
* **Inclusive Design:** Gender-neutral logic paths focusing on silhouettes, color theory, and professional aesthetics.
